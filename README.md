### Insights: 

✅ North America leads in revenue and tourist numbers for odd food tourism, significantly outperforming all other global regions in both sales and visitor count.

✅ Popularity outweighs extreme risk, as moderately risky "Exotic Meats" like Rocky Mountain Oysters drive more revenue than very risky but niche items like Pufferfish.

✅ The market is effectively categorized, moving beyond just "odd" to specific niches like Live Foods, Fermented Foods, and Dangerous Foods to target different tourist interests.

✅ Bird's Nest Soup stands out as a premium luxury item, explicitly highlighted for its high annual revenue, marking it as a valuable specialty product.

✅ Organ and exotic meats are the industry's core, forming the most prominent and profitable category that appeals to the broadest segment of adventurous eaters.

✅ High-risk foods remain a niche segment, with items like Live Octopus having lower popularity, catering only to the most extreme food adventurers.
